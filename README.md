# peoplelocator
Basic geolocation to locate people.

This project is a simple project to locate people without needing to put map as I couldn't find a sample without the map.
It's a base for my project for people checking in for work from their home. Just wanted to have the location name of the place people check in work from.

You will need to create your Web API to secure your Google Maps API Key.

Hope this will be useful for anyone needing this.
